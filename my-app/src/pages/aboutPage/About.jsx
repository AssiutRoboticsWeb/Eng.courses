      <p>
        Our platform is a student-driven project that aims to collect and
        organize as many engineering courses and recorded lectures as possible
        in one place. We believe that sharing knowledge is the fastest way to
        help students study and understand better. <br />
        <br /> The idea started from studentsâ€™ need to easily access lectures
        recorded by professors and teaching assistants. We organized and
        categorized the content by departments to make the learning experience
        simpler and more efficient.
